#Alternate Capitalization
This is for Code 07-B: Since this assignment came late in the day, I worked alone on this one and 07-A - so there's no whiteboard photo - I worked these out in the console.

**The challenge**
Given a string, capitalize the letters that occupy even indexes and odd indexes separately, and return as shown below. Index 0 will be considered even.

For example, capitalize("abcdef") = ['AbCdEf', 'aBcDeF']. See test cases for more examples.

The input will be a lowercase string with no spaces.


**the Process**
I knew that the solution was to split the string into an array and then replace the alternate characters, and then join it back into a string. It took me a few minutes to get all that straight, but once I did the for loops worked well and it was a quick path to the solution.

This took around 30 minutes.
