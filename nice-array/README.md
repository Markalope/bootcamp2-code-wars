# Code Challenge May 6th - Nice Array
Worked this out on the whiteboard with Karen and Antreo, at least so far as to agree on the basic theory of the function we needed. Had to fool around with it for a while in class and then at home to get it to work. This took a little longer than I expected, there were more errors in the full tests than there usually are, compared to the test cases.
