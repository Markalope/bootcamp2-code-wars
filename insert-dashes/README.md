# Insert Dashes
**The Problem**
Write a function insertDash(num)/InsertDash(int num) that will insert dashes ('-') between each two odd numbers in num. For example: if num is 454793 the output should be 4547-9-3. Don't count zero as an odd number.

**The Workgroup**
Mariah, Erik and I whiteboarded and talked this out.

**The Solution**
This took about 20 minutes or so to solve. We chose a method that involved a few steps, we had to experiment a little with making sure the values were returned at the right places.
