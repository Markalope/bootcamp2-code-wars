# Regex Username Validation 

**The Problem**
Write a simple regex to validate a username. Allowed characters are:

lowercase letters,
numbers,
underscore
Length should be between 4 and 16 characters (both included).

**The Process**
I pretty much worked this out on my own. I did about 15 minutes of research on regex syntax (attached in a JPEG) and then started experimenting in the Codewars practice area. I spoke to Injoon who helped me out getting my length expression in the right place.
