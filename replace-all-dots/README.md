I whiteboarded the code steps with Karen and Antreo.

## from Codewars
The code provided is supposed replace all the dots . in the specified String str with dashes -

But it's not working properly.

**Task**
Fix the bug so we can all go home early.

**Notes**
String str will never be null.

**The Borked code**
describe("Example Tests", function() {

  it("test dots", function(){
    Test.assertEquals(replaceDots("one.two.three"), "one-two-three", "Sorry, try again :-(");
  });
  
});

**My solution is in Solution.js**
