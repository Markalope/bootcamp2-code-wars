# Code 11 - Reversed Strings
Teamed up with Karen again - I swear this is the last time - since we were paired for the lab. We both immediately realized that this would be an easy one - we could either reverse the string using array methods, or write a for loop to reverse iterate through the sting and return the values.

**The Challenge**
Complete the solution so that it reverses the string value passed into it.

solution('world'); // returns 'dlrow'

**The Solution**
I went with the array method, which I refactored down into one line. Details attached. This took only a few minutes, as I suspected.
